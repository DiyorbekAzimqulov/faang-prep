"""
we are given 3 types of characters as parenthesis: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'
we need to validate whether parenthesis are matched with each other or not
they are given as string.
for example: ({[]}) is valid
({)} is invalid
so every opening parenthesis should have a closing parenthesis next to it
if next to it is opening parenthesis, then it should have a closing parenthesis next to it
